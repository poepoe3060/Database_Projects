# This is testing project.
# First of all, need to install Python 3.10
# I used ubuntu22.04 (linux OS), so Python 3.10 is a default one.
# Secodly, Sqlalchemy is needed to install on Python. The linux command is as follow
==> pip3 install sqlalchemy
## And we also need to install Postgresql on OS, there are many postgres versions. For thsi project I used Postgresql 16.
